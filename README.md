# 4CHV

A 4chan viewer for a more civilized age

- Downloads threads to create local html pages for a /comfy/ browsing experience
- Replies automatically arranged
- Thoughtful, insightful posts boosted
- Repetitive, non insightful posts downranked


## Installation

1. All you need is [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the `requests` package

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Add/remove any boards you are interested in `boards.txt`


3. Run the app

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

    Open any of the html files in your browser. New threads are downloaded every two seconds, so you may have to wait for a few minutes the first time.
