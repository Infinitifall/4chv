# 4CHV

A 4chan viewer for a more civilized age

- Downloads threads to create local html pages for a /comfy/ browsing experience

## Installation

1. All you need is [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the `requests` package

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Add/remove any boards you are interested in `boards.txt`


3. Run the app. Threads are downloaded every 2 seconds, so you may have to wait for a few minutes on first setup.
