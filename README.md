## Installation for Windows

1. Install Python if you haven't already from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Download this project [here](https://github.com/Infinitifall/4chv/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the folder

3. Open `boards.txt` and add/remove the boards you want, one board per line

4. Double click on the `run.py` file to start the script

It will start downloading threads and creating html files which you can open in your browser. New threads are downloaded every two seconds, so you may have to wait for a few minutes the first time.
